-- Around Boston, Brookline, and Somerville, you might catch sight of 
-- Union Square Donuts, a shop famous in the area for its delicious confections.
--  Suppose that Union Square Donuts has been around for a while and, 
--  while their paper receipts have worked well so far, they‚Äôre hoping for a 
--  system to help them handle more customers. In fact, they‚Äôve just hired you 
--  to design a database fitting for their shop. In exchange, free donuts? üç©


-- Ingredients
-- We certainly need to keep track of our ingredients. Some of the typical ingredients 
-- we use include flour, yeast, oil, butter, and several different types of sugar. 
-- Moreover, we would love to keep track of the price we pay per unit of ingredient
--  (whether it‚Äôs pounds, grams, etc.).

-- Donuts
-- We‚Äôll need to include our selection of donuts, past and present! For each donut 
-- on the menu, we‚Äôd love to include three things:
-- The name of the donut
-- Whether the donut is gluten-free
-- The price per donut
-- Oh, and it‚Äôs important that we be able to look up the ingredients 
-- for each of the donuts!

-- Orders
-- We love to see customers in person, though we realize a good number of people might
--  order online nowadays. We‚Äôd love to be able to keep track of those online orders. 
--  We think we would need to store:
-- An order number, to keep track of each order internally
-- All the donuts in the 

-- Customers
-- The customer who placed the order. We suppose we could assume only one customer
--  places any given order.
-- Customers
-- Oh, and we realize it would be lovely to keep track of some information about 
-- each of our customers. We‚Äôd love to remember the history of the orders they‚Äôve made.
--  In that case, we think we should store:
-- A customer‚Äôs first and last name
-- A history of their orders
